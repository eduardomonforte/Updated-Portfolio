        My name is Eduardo. I suck at writing, which is why I made the smart choice of studying Literature fresh out of high school – that only lasted 9 months. I like to call that period my <a href="http://ultimateclassicrock.com/john-lennon-lost-weekend/">"Lost Weekend"</a>, although it wasn't <a href="http://ultimateclassicrock.com/john-lennon-ufo/">as epic as John Lennon's</a> and, in hindsight, I realized you have to be truly lost in order to find yourself. More smart decisions followed: I started studying a B.A. in Communication shortly after, and I managed to see it all the way through, becoming my career's student body president in my last year of college.

        After finally getting my super useful degree, destiny willed it that I would be hired as a writer in a design agency, even though – as we've previously established – I suck at writing. I managed to not make a fool of myself during that time, but eventually I realized that I wasn't having fun doing it, and I wanted to pursue new things to suck at. That's how I decided to learn coding: so that I can maybe use this new skill to have fun, found a startup and make it suck, big time.
